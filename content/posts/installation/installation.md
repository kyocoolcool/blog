This post will give you step by step instructions on how to install and use this theme.

### Requirements

- Hugo Version 0.68.0 or higher

### Installation

- Create your site if you haven't already

```console
hugo new site my-site -f=yaml
cd my-site
git init
```

- Add the theme as git sub-module

```console
git submodule add https://github.com/hossainemruz/toha.git themes/toha
```

>Don't use SSH URL of the theme during adding as git sub-module. Also, don't clone the theme in your `themes` directory using `git clone`. They don't work well with Github Action or Netlify.

If you want to customize the theme templates, then fork it and use the fork as your theme.

### Configuration

Configure your `config.yaml` file of your site as below:

```yaml
baseURL: http://example.org/
languageCode: en-us
title: "Toha"
theme: "toha"

# Allow raw html in markdown file
markup:
  goldmark:
    renderer:
      unsafe: true

# Enable Google Analytics
googleAnalytics: <your google analytics id>

# Enable Disqus forum
# optional
disqusShortname: <your disqus short code>

# Enable global emoji support
enableEmoji: true

# Custom parameters
params:
  # Github Repo URL. This is used to add "Improve This Page" button
  gitRepo: <your site's Github repo URL>
```

You can just copy the content for `config.yaml` files from `theme/toha/exampleSite/config.yaml`.

### Usage

Run your hugo site with this theme.

```console
hugo server -w
```

Don't panic if the generated site does not look like what have you seen in the demo. Now, you have to provide some data in `data` folder of your site.

Follow the posts giving step by step instructions for configuring your data folder from [here](https://toha.netlify.app/posts/configuration/home-section/home-section/).

You can also follow the sample format given in `themes/toha/exampleSite/data` directory.
